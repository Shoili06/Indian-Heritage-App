It is the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one; however, 'Mysore Palace' refers specifically to this one within the Old Fort."
                        "\n\n\n"
                        "HISTORY: \n\nThe last palace, now known as the Old Palace or the Wooden Palace, was burnt into ashes during the 1896 Dasara festivities. Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV and his mother Maharani Kempananjammanni Devi, commissioned the British architect Lord Henry Irwin to build a new palace. Meanwhile, the royal family stayed in the closeby Jaganmohan Palace. The construction was overseen by B. P. Raghavulu Naidu, an executive engineer in the Mysore Palace division. He had conducted elaborate architectural studies during visits to Delhi, Madras, and Calcutta, and these were used in planning for the new palace. The construction cost was placed at Rs 41,47,913 (around \$30 million adjusted to inflation) and was completed in 1912.",
