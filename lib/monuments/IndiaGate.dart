The India Gate, even though a war memorial, evokes the architectural style of the triumphal arch like the Arch of Constantine, outside the Colosseum in Rome, and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens."

On the occasion, the viceroy said, 'The stirring tales of individual heroism, will live for ever in the annals of this country' , and that the memorial which was a tribute to the memory of heroes, 'known and unknown' would inspire, future generations to endure hardships with similar fortitude and 'no less valour'.",
